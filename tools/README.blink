About the most elementary test of a board with a programmable
microcontroller is a 'blink-a-LED' program (the equivalent of 'Hello
World'). We use such programs to test the Jallib device files, and
we made these programs also part of Jallib distribution as example
of how to use the device files. These samples are very simple and
use only the library with delay procedures. They work for us, so
they should work for you! When you have an issue with compiling your
program try one of these samples first before complaining.

In the sample directory you can find at least one blink-a-LED sample
program for every PICmicro called '<pictype>_blink_xxx.jal'. The
'xxx' indicates the type of oscillator, for example HS, INTOSC,
HS_USB or, INTOSC_USB). If you chose to use one of those programs
check if it matches your board configuration, in particular the pin
to which you connected your LED and the specification of the
oscillator type. Depending on the features of the specific PIC the
blink-a-LED sample uses either the internal oscillator running at 4
MHz or an external high speed oscillator of 20 MHz, a PIC with USB
module may run at 48 MHz.

When you want to use PLL, in addition to specifying the proper
'fuse_def target OSC' keyword, you may have to activate PLL
(typically OSCTUNE_PLLEN = TRUE). Read the datasheet and browse
through the device file of the specific PICmicro to see which
fuse_def pragmas apply to your target PIC. For more detailed
information about the device files you may read its documentation:
devicefiles.html.

When you encounter a problem, please inform us. The most effective
way is to report at https://github.com/jallib/jallib. Open 'Issues'
to see if there is already a report to which you could add your
comments, otherwise open a new issue.

Have fun!
