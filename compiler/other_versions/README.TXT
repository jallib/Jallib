The original JAL compiler is currently released on Windows and Linux for 32-bit and 64-bit OS-es.

Versions for other OS-es and older versions of the compiler can be found here but are no longer supported.
For some older compilers, 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Windows and Linux are not always available.

Note that older versions of the compiler will not work with certain device files due to new pragmas.

Compiler versions are indicated by the directory names.

Always use the most recent version of the JAL compiler. Currently the following names are used:
jalv2.exe        : Windows 32-bit binary 
jalv2_64.exe     : Windows 64-bit binary 
jalv2-i686       : Linux 32-bit binary
jalv2-x86-64     : Linux 64-bit binary
