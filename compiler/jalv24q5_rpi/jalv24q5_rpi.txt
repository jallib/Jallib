This folder contains the binary of the JAL compiler (version 2.4q5) for the Raspberry Pi and similar single-board computers. It has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3, and an Orange Pi 2 Plus.

It will also probably work on similar ARM-based single-board computers. If not, you can compile your own version using the following steps, assuming a C compiler (e.g., gcc) is already installed on your SBC:

1. Download the compiler from its creator s [home page](http://www.casadeyork.com/jalv2/) and unzip the file in your home directory:

    cd ~
    wget http://www.casadeyork.com/jalv2/archive/jalv24q5src.zip 
    unzip jalv24q5src.zip

2. Create a directory named 'bin' in the directory that was just created:

    mkdir ./jalv24q5/bin

3. Remove the error-on-warning flag from the makefile:

    sed -ibak "s/ -Werror//" ~/jalv24q5/src/Makefile.inc

4. Now compile the compiler:

    cd ~/jalv24q5/src
    make

5. The resulting binary, named 'jalv2', should be in ~/jalv24q5/bin.  You can add it to the other compilers that come with the default Jallib installation or move it to another folder where you keep your local binaries, such as ~/bin or /usr/local/bin:

    mv ~/jalv24q5bin/bin/jalv2 ~/jalv2/compiler
