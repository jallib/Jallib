    <p>USB stands for Universal Serial Bus and has replaced on may computer
    the standard (RS232) serial interface.</p>

    <p>It is the most popular connection used to connect a computer to devices
    such as digital cameras, printers, scanners, and external hard drives. USB
    is a cross-platform technology that is supported by most of the major
    operating systems. On Windows, it can be used with Windows 98 and higher.
    USB is a hot-swappable technology, meaning that USB devices can be added
    and removed without having to restart the computer. USB is also “plug and
    play”. When you connect a USB device to your PC, your operating sytem
    should detect the device and even install the drivers needed to use
    it..</p>

    <p>There are various versions of USB. The original version of USB is USB
    1.0, supporting speeds of up to 11 Mbps and was used mostly to connect
    keyboards and mice. This is also the version that is supported by the JAL
    USB driver although the PIC USB hardware is able to support USB 2.0 which
    supports speeds up to 480 Mbps. If you want to know more about the higher
    USB version you can find all information on the Internet..</p>

    <section><title>How does USB work?</title><p>That is a little bit complex
    to explain. If you want to know more about this, visit the official <xref
    format="html" href="https://usb.org/" scope="external"> <apiname>USB
    website</apiname> </xref> where you can find all specifications of the
    Universal Serial Bus. You can also find websites which explain this very
    well like <xref format="html"
    href="https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.shtml"
    scope="external"> <apiname>USB in a nutshell</apiname> </xref>.</p><p>What
    you should know is that it uses 4 connections of which two are for power
    and the other two, called Data+ and Data-, are for communication. There
    are different types of connectors as shown in the following
    picture.</p><p><image href="images/usb_pinout.jpg" otherprops="clickable"

    href="tutorial_usb2.xml"> <apiname>next section</apiname> </xref> we will
    create a program that makes it possible to control the LEDs on a PIC from
    a (host) computer using the USB as serial port. For the serial interface
    from the computer to the PIC, a free terminal emulation program <xref
    format="html" href="https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm"
    scope="external"> <apiname>Termite</apiname> </xref> is used, but any
    other terminal emulation program will do.</p></section>
