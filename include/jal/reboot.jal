-- Description: This library provides a single procedure, reboot() which,
-- when run, will reboot the PIC. If USB is present, it will disable this
-- first and  delay for 2 seconds, which should give any connected master to
-- register the disconnect.
-- .
-- N.B. Does not work on architectures that don't have a reset assembler
-- instruction. I've put in a check to report this.

include delay

procedure reboot() is
   if (defined(UCON_USBEN) == true) then
      -- Disable USB.
      UCON_USBEN = low

      -- 2 second delay.
      _usec_delay(2_000_000)
   end if

   -- PIC_14H and PIC_16 certainly have reset.
   if (target_cpu == PIC_12 | target_cpu == PIC_14) then
      _error "This CPU does not have a reset instruction"
   else
      asm reset
   end if

   -- Shouldn't be reached.
   forever loop
   end loop

end procedure
