-- Description: this program shows how to use adc library. It regurlarly performs an
-- Analog-to-Digital Conversion, on pin RA0/AN0 and sends the result through serial.
-- 
-- Notes: as output, this sample produces characters on a serial link, and uses delay library.
-- First be sure you're able to run serial and delay tests.
--
-- Few words about diagram: this program performs ADC on channels AN0, so you can measure
-- any voltage source connected to these channels (no more than 5V please).
-- To test the whole, you can use a voltage divider:
--		
--     5V
--     |
--     Z
--     Z R1        -----------
--     Z           |
--     |------ AN0-|   PIC
--     Z           |
--     Z R2        |
--     Z
--     |
--    GND
--
--		- R1=1K, R2=1K: you should get ~127/~512 as ADC value (low/high)
-- 		- R1=1K, R2=2.2K: you should get ~175/~704 as ADC value (low/high)
--
-- ok, now let's configure ADC
-- we want to measure using high resolution
-- (that's our choice, we could use low resolution as well)
const bit ADC_HIGH_RESOLUTION = low
-- we said we want 1 analog channel...
const byte ADC_NCHANNEL = 1
-- and no voltage reference
const byte ADC_NVREF = 0
-- now we can include the library
include adc
-- and run the initialization step
adc_init()


-- will periodically send those chars
var word wmeasure
var byte bmeasure
const byte wprefix[] = "Result in high resolution: "
const byte bprefix[] = "Result in low  resolution: "
forever loop
   -- get ADC result, on channel 0
   -- this means we're currently reading on pin AN0 !

   -- access results in high resolution
   wmeasure = adc_read(0)
   -- wmeasure contains the result, as a word (byte*2)
   print_string(serial_hw_data,wprefix)
   print_word_dec(serial_hw_data,wmeasure)
   print_crlf(serial_hw_data)

   -- though we are in high resolution mode,
   -- we can still get a result as a byte, as though
   -- it were in low resolution.
   bmeasure = adc_read_low_res(0)
   print_string(serial_hw_data,bprefix)
   print_byte_dec(serial_hw_data,bmeasure)
   print_crlf(serial_hw_data)

   -- and sleep a litte to prevent flooding serial...
   delay_1ms(200)
end loop
