-- Description: this sample shows how to implements an i2c hardware slave,
-- based in i2c_hw_slave_isr.jal library. Basically, this i2c slave waits for
-- a byte, and when required, it sends byte + 1 (send "a", you'll get a "b")
-- --
-- This sample is aimed to be used with *_i2c_hw_master_echo.jal samples,
-- which is the master part.
