-- Description: this sample shows how to implements an i2c hardware slave,
-- based in i2c_hw_slave_isr.jal library. Basically, this i2c slave waits for
-- a byte, and when required, it sends byte + 1 (send "a", you'll get a "b")
-- --
-- This sample is aimed to be used with *_i2c_hw_master_echo.jal samples,
-- which is the master part.

include 18f14k50

-- This file is the setup for my homebrew, 18f14k50 board
-- Currently it is a bare board, with just a PIC and a couple of headers
-- A 12 MHz external crystal and 15pf caps connected to OSC1/2
-- pin 17 (Vusb) with a 220 nF capacitor to the ground
-- The connection between PC and the 18F14k50
-- +5v to power the board (don't forget 100nf decoupling cap
-- data- wire to pin 18 (D-)
-- data+ wire to pin 19 (D+)
-- ground wire to the Vss of the PIC
-- even though the external crystal is 12 MHz, the configuration is such that
-- the CPU clock is derived from the 96 Mhz PLL clock (div2), therefore set
-- target frequency to 48 MHz

-- in the program), it is suggested to use "pragma inline", to save
-- stack usage

-- during communication between master and us
